## Projects
### Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance Car
For my Extended Project Qualification, I developed a fully autonomous robot car using Arduino. It continuously scans its surroundings using a servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor and avoids obstacles while navigating. The car is fully self-driven and coded from scratch.
**Technologies:** Arduino, C/C++, Ultrasonic Sensors, Servo Motor, DC Motors.

### Cafateria Monitoring System (Univeristy Group Project)
Worked as part of a team to design a system that tracks the number of people entering and exiting the university cafeteria. The system  integrates various sensors, including ultrasonic, vibration, light sensors, and buttons, for accurate detection and data collection.
**Technologies"": Arduino, C, Sensor Integration

### Chess AI Engine (A-Level NEA)
Created a chess enigne in Python as part of my A-Level Computer Science coursework, achieving an A grade. The engine includes multiple difficulty levels utilising techniques such as Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms. I built a GUI for it using the Tkinter library in Python.
**Technologies**: Python, Tkinter, OOP, AI algorithms

## Hackathons and Competitions
### National Cipher Challenge
I participated as a team representing my school in the National Cipher Challenge organised by the University of Southampton. We collaboratively wrote programs in Python to decrypt ciphertext for a magnitude of ciphers, which helped improve my programming versatility.

## Work Experience
### IT Technician - Every Child Online 2023
Organised and completed a week of work experience at an IT asset disposition (ITAD) company.
- Installed operating systems via PXE boot and configured BIOS settings.
- Worked alongside a team to troubleshoot hardware and firmware issues.
- Deconstructed and rebuilt PCs, and recycled components (including PCBs).
This opportunity refined my tech literacy, teamwork, and gave me hands-on experience with real-world IT hardware.
